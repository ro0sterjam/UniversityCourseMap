VThis seminar course examines the diverse postwar experiences of countries in East Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. The region comprises a wide range of countries that at once differ, but also share some commonalities in cultural, ethnic, and religious backgrounds, in levels of social and economic development, and in political regimes. To make sense of this diversity, a comparative, multi-disciplinary perspective will be introduced. Highlighting the principal theme of interdependence \u2013of countries but also of fields of enquiry (geography, history, political science) \u2013the first term will look at the interactions between economic development, political change, and migration. The second term will continue with these themes, but will pay particular attention to environmental issues, and history as memory and politics. The course will critically examine various social science theories that seek to explain socio-economic change in its many manifestations, and aim to find an appropriate balance between the particular and the general or universal.

VAs they travel through space and time, material objects play an important role in the production of diasporic identity. This course focuses on the culturally defined and socially regulated processes of circulation, transaction, and use to examine the ways in which diasporic communities identify value and meaning in objects and how those objects give value to the social relations that define communities. Through readings, guest lectures and discussions, we will address questions such as: What roles do objects play in the constitution and reproduction of diasporic communities? What qualities are read into objects, through what mechanisms, and how does their meaning vary across space? What is the relationship between object, narrative, affect and identity? What conditions affect the durability of the relation between object and diasporic identity?

We will focus upon the important developments of literary writing over time, from the inception of New Literature in the 1910s, the development of realism and modernism of the 1930s, to the emergency of post-revolution and postmodernist writings of the 1990s. Great emphasis is also placed on generating a dialogue on interpretations of key works. In doing so, we will be exercising the skills of reading literary works in terms of aesthetic choices and strategies of cultural politics.

The course will first familiarize the students with the diplomatic and intellectual context of the formation of archaeology as a field of study in Europe and analyse the role archaeology played in the production of knowledge about the Middle East. Next, the course will examine the archaeological practices on the ground (and underground) and inquire what happens in the contact zone between foreign and local archaeologists. Finally, we will trace the ways in which emergent nationalist discourse challenge, appropriate and imitate the historical narratives of Western archaeology.

VStudents will be introduced to the basic concepts of immunity to infectious disease and how breakdown of the immune response can lead to auto-immunity. We will trace the history of current ideas in immunology and the immune response by examining how bacteria and viruses cause disease and the initial discoveries that led to such developments as vaccination. Current topical and newsworthy infectious diseases (HIV, tuberculosis, SARS, avian flu) will be used as examples of how the immune system copes with microbial infections.

Ethnography of the intimate realms of affect raises important questions about knowledge production and methodology as well as offering insight into how people come to act upon the world and what the human consequences of such action are. The course will also examine how the intimate is socially produced and harnessed in the service of politics and culture. Topics will include grief and its lack; dreams and activism; love and social change; memory and imperialism; sexuality and care; and violence and hope.

VIndependent Research courses allow students to pursue a specific topic of interest. These courses are offered at the 400-level, as full or half courses. Students work independently with a professor in the Department who acts as research supervisor. There are no formal class meetings, lectures, or readings other than what is agreed to with the supervisor. Professors accept supervisory responsibility at their discretion. They are not required to serve as research supervisors. It is recommended that students approach a professor working in the same sub-discipline of sociology. Often students become interested in a topic through a SOC course and approach the instructor of that course for supervision; however, this is not required. Enrolment priority is given to sociology specialists and majors.

Despite notable breakthroughs in Taiwan, Korea and more recently, Indonesia, the region remains home to a remarkably diverse group of functioning authoritarian and semi-authoritarian regimes, including Vietnam, North Korea, Myanmar, Singapore, China and Malaysia. In the light of the growing interest among social scientists in the authoritarian revival, this course will seek to explore the conditions for authoritarian sustainability and prospects for political change in the region.

Starting with Harold Innis's theory of staple growth and the debate about the role of foreign investment in its economic (mis)development, we examine how Canada, having long resisted continental economic integration, turned to free trade as a panacea in the 1980s. The course ends with a detailed investigation of NAFTA's significance for Canadian public policy options in the light of the US war on terrorism. It is strongly recommended that students do not take both POL318H1 and POL341H1 at the same time because of the heavy work load.

Its first aim is to help students to familiarize themselves with some of the major developments in the European and North-American theatre of the twentieth century by studying the works of its main creators such as Meyerhold, Grotowski, Brook, Kantor, Wilson, Bausch, and Lepage. The second aim is to investigate a wide range of theories (psychoanalytic, post-colonial, feminist, gay and lesbian/queer, and many more) that are central to critical debates in the profession. We discuss, evaluate, and test these theories against plays and performances, while maintaining the interaction of theory and praxis as the central focus of our investigation. Readings in English.

This course examines the crystal and defect structures which determine the electrical and mass transport behaviours and the effects of microstructure on optical, magnetic, dielectric, and thermomechanical properties. The influence of these structure-property relations on the performance of ceramic materials in specific applications such as sensors, solid oxide fuel cells, magnets, and structural components is explored.

After a brief review, the course continues from where NML310Y1leaves off. Following the same teaching approach and learning philosophy, the goal of this course is to enable the students to reach a superior level of proficiency in Arabic. To this end, the materials covered are designed to strengthen the students reading and writing skills, refine and expand their knowledge of sentence structure, morphological patterns, verb system, and enrich their cultural background. The primary method is analysis of sophisticated authentic texts covering a wide range of genres and drawn from different parts of the Arabic speaking world. Although the main focus remains to be on Modern Standard Arabic, texts from the Classical Arabic literary tradition will be introduced incrementally throughout the course.

VIndependent Research courses allow students to pursue a specific topic of interest. These courses are offered at the 400-level, as full or half courses. Students work independently with a professor in the Department who acts as research supervisor. There are no formal class meetings, lectures, or readings other than what is agreed to with the supervisor. Professors accept supervisory responsibility at their discretion. They are not required to serve as research supervisors. It is recommended that students approach a professor working in the same sub-discipline of sociology. Often students become interested in a topic through a SOC course and approach the instructor of that course for supervision; however, this is not required. Enrolment priority is given to sociology specialists and majors.

After a series of lectures/seminars on fieldwork methods, fieldwork ethics, and health and safety issues in the field (which may include some basic introductory language classes), students then undertake a 2 \u2013 5 week period of field study overseas, depending on logistical and other constraints. Previous field studies have been for periods of 4-5 weeks overseas in Thailand and Malaysia. While overseas, students undergo orientation workshops, meet peers in host universities, and visit potential field sites before conducting an intensive period of fieldwork in small groups of 3-5 students.

VWhat is the relationship between place and belonging, between territory and memory? How have the experiences of migration and dislocation challenged the modern assumption that the nation-state should be the limit of identification? What effect has the emergence of new media of communication had upon the coherence of cultural and political boundaries? All of these questions and many more form part of the subject matter of Diaspora and Transnational Studies. This introductory course ex-amines the historical and contemporary movements of peoples and the complex issues of identity and experience to which these processes give rise as well as the creative possibilities that flow from movement and being moved. The area of study is comparative and interdisciplinary, drawing from the social sciences, history, the arts and humanities. Accordingly, this course provides the background to the subject area from diverse perspectives and introduces students to a range of key debates in the field, with particular attention to questions of history, globalization, cultural production and the creative imagination.

VReligion and aesthetics are sometimes constructed as separate categories, but in South Asia religion is not often conceptually distinct from an autonomous sphere of aesthetic reflection. In conversation with recent sociological, anthropological, and philosophical writings, we will explore this issue through careful study of a variety of Sanskrit sources: the epics, Abhinavaguptas commentary on the Natya Sastra, Vaisnava, Saiva, and Jaina appropriations of Sanskrit aesthetics and courtly poetry, and the works of Rabindranath Tagore. Students are encouraged to work with sources in the primary languages, although materials will also be provided in translation

It will centre around the relatively recent use of K-theory to study Bratteli's approximately finite-dimensional C*-algebras---both to classify them (a result that can be formulated and proved purely algebraically), and to prove that the class of these C*-algebras---what Bratteli called AF algebras---is closed under passing to extensions (a result that uses the Bott periodicity feature of K-theory). Students will be encouraged to prepare oral or written reports on various subjects related to the course, including basic theory and applications

VMost urban courses taught in the English-speaking world implicitly or explicitly focus on large North American, European, or Australian cities. While these places are interesting in their own right, studying them as the sole model of urbanization is misleading. To a great extent, the societies of the westernized, developed world are already highly-urbanized and have been so for decades. Cities outside of this sphere, by contrast, are generally growing much faster, and experiencing greater social and economic upheaval as a result. Understanding non-North American urbanization is a vital part of understanding cities in general. This course is an attempt to introduce students to processes of urbanization that are occurring in places other than North America. There will be a particular focus on comparing the urban form, economies, and social life in cities around the world.

Special emphasis will be devoted to encounters between scholars in Western Europe, Iran, India, and the Ottoman Empire. This seminar-style course explains that Orientals gazed and returned the gaze, and in the process of cultural looking, they, like their Occidental counterparts, exoticized and eroticized the Farangi-Other. In the interplay of looks between Orientals and Occidentals, there was no steady position of spectatorship, no objective observer, and no aperspectival position. Intended for upper year students.

VNo understanding of contemporary Chinese is possible without understanding the ramifications of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (1966-1976). This course seeks to consider this tumultuous episode as a field of historical research and conceptual inquiry: What was the meaning of culture in the Cultural Revolution? To what extent was it revolutionary? What did really it mean to talk about class and class struggle during the movement? How is the Cultural Revolution remembered and represented? And, how do we understand Chinas globalizing present in the historical context of the Cultural Revolution? This course invites you to explore such questions by critically examining a wide variety of sources, including scholarly accounts, official documents, personal memoirs, oral histories, and literary works.

Students work independently with a professor in the Department who acts as research supervisor. There are no formal class meetings, lectures, or readings other than what is agreed to with the supervisor. Professors accept supervisory responsibility at their discretion. They are not required to serve as research supervisors. It is recommended that students approach a professor working in the same sub-discipline of sociology. Often students become interested in a topic through a SOC course and approach the instructor of that course for supervision; however, this is not required.

VAround 2000 BC, the island of Crete sees the emergence of what are arguably the earliest towns and states in European prehistory. At the heart of this new social order are the so-called \u2018palaces\u2019, massive architectural complexes usually interpreted as seats of administrative and political authority. However, fresh discoveries over the past two decades, coupled recently with radical new interpretations, require a fundamental rethinking of the nature of the palaces and their role in Minoan society. This course will provide students with an active opportunity to learn about the latest developments in Minoan art, architecture, and archaeology.

VIndependent Research courses allow students to pursue a specific topic of interest. These courses are offered at the 300-level, as full or half courses. Students work independently with a professor in the Department who acts as research supervisor. There are no formal class meetings, lectures, or readings other than what is agreed to with the supervisor. Professors accept supervisory responsibility at their discretion. They are not required to serve as research supervisors. It is recommended that students approach a professor working in the same sub-discipline of sociology. Often students become interested in a topic through a SOC course and approach the instructor of that course for supervision; however, this is not required.

VIndependent Research courses allow students to pursue a specific topic of interest. These courses are offered at the 400-level, as full or half courses. Students work independently with a professor in the Department who acts as research supervisor. There are no formal class meetings, lectures, or readings other than what is agreed to with the supervisor. Professors accept supervisory responsibility at their discretion. They are not required to serve as research supervisors. It is recommended that students approach a professor working in the same sub-discipline of sociology. Often students become interested in a topic through a SOC course and approach the instructor of that course for supervision; however, this is not required. Enrolment priority is given to sociology specialists and majors.

It is designed for students with no prior knowledge of Arabic language and it follows a teaching approach that places equal emphasis on the development of all language skills: reading, writing, listening, and speaking. The fundamental learning philosophy underlying this approach is that proficiency in a foreign language is best achieved through consistent, deliberate, and systematic practice. From the outset, students are strongly encouraged to develop the habit of consistently and continuously practicing learned material.

VThis course, required for majors and minors but open to all who have met the pre-req, explores a range of approaches to the field of American Studies. The course is organized around the decade of the 1920s, a period of tremendous social, political, and economic change as the U.S. emerged from WWI as a global industrial power and Americans debated competing ideas about the meanings of modernity. The course looks at the 1920s through a series of thematic weeks, drawing from interdisciplinary primary and secondary sources, such as black migration and urban modernities; gender, sexuality, and global beauty culture; immigration policy and racial formation; modernism in the visual arts; Prohibition and gangsters; market empires and global commodity chains. Students will be introduced to some of the many theories and methods that have animated the field of American Studies, including historical methods; formal analysis of visual and literary texts; commodity chain analysis; race, commodity, gender, diaspora and affect.

VThis course will examine the religious beliefs and practices of Muslims. The period of time covered by the course is from shortly before the birth of Islam in the 7th century to the present. Attention will focus on the central concerns of the religion: God, Prophethood, Holy Book, Community, the Individual. The sources and development of the Sharí\u2018a, the teachings of the mystical tradition, the contributions to art and science, social institutions such as marriage and divorce, family life, the position of women in Islam, modern social changes and the more recent impact of the West on Muslim lands (and vice versa) will also be discussed. Lectures, assignments and workshops will be framed by the close identification between \u201creligion\u201d and \u201ccivilization\u201d found in the Islamic sources, beginning with the Qur \u2019an. Doubtless in part a reflection of the 7th century \u201cview from the Hijaz,\u201d of the contemporary and competing civilizations of the Christian Eastern Roman Empire in the west and the Zoroastrian Iranian Sasanid Empire in the east, this identification may be seen as a presupposition of Islamic religious discourse, beginning with the two foundational opposites, the defining and characteristic Islamic religio-cultural categories: jahiliyya, \u201cignorance, barbarism\u201d and islamiyya, \u201cIsl\u0101m\u201d.

VBasic and advanced principles of genetic analysis applied to the study of two of the best-understood eukaryotic model organisms: the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. We emphasize the use of genetic approaches to address problems in cell biology and development, such as the regulation of cell fate. Much of the knowledge gained from these simple organisms has proven broadly applicable, and the same principles of developmental genetic analysis underlie efforts to understand the development of more complex organisms.

It asks what it means to enter modernity under colonial rule, and questions the relationship between imperialism, writing and subjectivity in particular. Topics covered include the role of literature in elaborating new concepts of subjectivity, literature and the fine arts as assimilatory practices, the emergence of urban space and consequent reconfiguration of notions of the rural, and changing notions of time and space in the cultural products of nativism. Readings of literary works will be accompanied by showings of paintings and photographs from the period, as well as discussion of theoretical essays on modernism.

VIndependent Research courses allow students to pursue a specific topic of interest. These courses are offered at the 300-level, as full or half courses. Students work independently with a professor in the Department who acts as research supervisor. There are no formal class meetings, lectures, or readings other than what is agreed to with the supervisor. Professors accept supervisory responsibility at their discretion. They are not required to serve as research supervisors. It is recommended that students approach a professor working in the same sub-discipline of sociology. Often students become interested in a topic through a SOC course and approach the instructor of that course for supervision; however, this is not required.

VA comprehensive investigation of synthetic methods for preparing diverse classes of inorganic materials with properties intentionally tailored for a particular use. Begins with a primer on solid-state materials and electronic band description of solids followed by a survey of archetypical solids that have had a dramatic influence on the materials world, some new developments in materials chemistry and a look at perceived future developments in materials research and technology. Strategies for synthesizing many different classes of materials with intentionally designed structures and compositions, textures and morphologies are then explored in detail emphasizing how to control the relations between structure and property of materials and ultimately function and utility. A number of contemporary issues in materials research are critically evaluated to appreciate recent highlights in the field of materials chemistry - an emerging sub-discipline of chemistry.

VSoutheast Asia has been, and still is comprised of predominantly rural and agrarian societies. This module seeks to develop an understanding of peasant life in the region. Topics to be studied include the village as a construct, the \u201cmoral economy\u201d of the peasantry, land and man relations, economic output, and peasant beliefs, consciousness, and cultural expressions. With the peasants\u2019 increasing involvement in the world market and the nation-state, it is also important to consider the penetration of capitalism into the rural economy, as well as the demand for supra-village identification and loyalties. Notions of \u201cdevelopment\u201d as they pertain to the peasants, and as postulated by the state, non-governmental organizations and the peasants themselves are also discussed.

Tracing, then, the transnational turn in the anthropology of sexuality, the course engages important debates about culture, locality, and globalization. By focusing on the transnational movement of desires, practices, and pleasures through activisms, mass media, and tourism, the course asks how sex is global and how globalization is thoroughly sexed. Course material will stress, but not be limited to, forms of same-sex or otherwise queer sexualities.

It considers images of prosperous private enclaves, of declining and difficult to access places, of racialized and segregated areas, of banality and homogeneity, of precarity and polarization, and of creative social struggles. It assesses these different visions through an analysis of urban growth and change since WWII. The course will focus on themes of public and private space; class, race and segregation; gender and suburban space; immigration; urban sprawl, and the changing social and economic geography of the suburbs. It examines North American areas, with examples from Australia and Europe.

What might we mean when we say that a work, a piece of music or a dance for example expresses something? What is it to express? And what is the nature of interpretation? Are there any constraints or boundaries on interpretation? We will draw on both philosophers and non-philosophers to explore these sorts of questions.

The approach to the course is broad rather than deep. We will concentrate on the concepts underlying such fascinating topics as planetary motion, chaos, the nature of light, time travel, black holes, matter waves, Schrodinger's cat, quarks, and climate change. We will uncover the wonders of the classical and the quantum worlds courtesy of Galileo, Newton, Maxwell, Einstein, Heisenberg and many others.(PHY100H1 is primarily intended as a Breadth Requirement course for students in the Humanities and Social Science)

For centuries Altaic peoples (Turks and Mongols), originally nomads in the Eurasian steppes (and mountains), played varied and crucial roles in the lands of the Middle Eastas raiders, migrants, slave-soldiers, conquerors, and state-builders. Topics to be covered include pastoral nomadism, steppe warfare, clan, tribal and state structures, ethnicity, sedentarization, and the roles of physical geography and ecology.

VOur understanding of space and power has shifted radically in the past half century. Space no longer implies only regions, nations or territory; power is not simply a question of domination, control, or forms of political representation. Space and power are intricately related. This course explores a shift in our ways of thinking about space and power, focusing specifically on the works of Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze. Through the works of Deleuze and Foucault, students are introduced to a variety of ways that space and power are organized and contested. The course begins with the maps in our heads: what kinds of spatial systems organize dominant world-views, how have these changed over time? What spatial metaphors do we use to think about power \u2013 as hidden and operating at a depth, or as a surface effect? How does the social organization of space figure in the development of different technologies and techniques of power? How do technologies of power become organized, serialized, dispersed, transformed and contested?

VThis course will examine the phenomenon of individuals and communities who rebel against the general social norms upheld by the majority in societies throughout history. These societal conventions can include generally-accepted moral and religious tenets, as well as the formal legal or political powers employed by those with the levers of social control. The rebels motives can range from the purely criminal, as with many notorious outlaws, to struggles for social justice, in the case of rebellious slaves or proponents of civil disobedience. Students will develop a theoretical framework which they can apply to the lives and motivations of a diverse representation of social rebels and outsiders, among them: pirates and mutineers, bandits and members of street/biker gangs, anarchists, disaffected intellectuals and religious leaders, punks and goths. Besides examining the sociological and philosophical aspects of rebellion, the course will consider the rebel as a prominent element in popular culture.

Some commentators assert that a more tightly interconnected world can exacerbate financial disruptions, worsen the gap between rich and poor nations, undermine democracy, imperil national cultures, harm the environment, and give unconstrained freedom to predatory corporations. Others proclaim that globalization - understood as capitalism and free markets - fosters economic growth, Victoria College encourages creative collaboration, inspires technological breakthroughs, and enhances human prospects for a better life, in rich and poor countries alike, in unprecedented ways.

VBeginning with Memórias Póstumas de Brás Cubas, Machado de Assis developed the art of creating characters who prefigure the 20th and 21st century selves: contradictory, often delusional. His novels destroy whatever certainties the late 19th century offered. The course examines the transformation of Machado through readings of his novels. (Taught in Portuguese in 2011-2012)

VSince at least the late 1700s, the effects of capitalism across the globe have profoundly transformed both the rural and urban landscapes of human livelihood, consumption, production and governance in Asia. While colonial empires have declined, new empires have emerged, and a growing number of countries have witnessed the rise of nationalism and independent states, political and technological revolutions, and most recently neoliberal globalization. The varied nature and specificities of these dramatic transformations are only beginning to be understood. This course theorizes and explores \u201cAsian modernities\u201d in a comparative framework. It is aimed at students wishing to better understand the great transformations of 20th and 21st century Asia in a global context.

The course will begin with theoretical studies on the heroic epic as a literary genre and on oral storytelling traditions cross-culturally. We will then engage in a comparative study and close reading of several Asian epics together with a study of related epic performance practices. Topics to be considered include the social functions and historicity of epic, the nature of heroism and the epic journey, encounters with and characterizations of dangerous and non-human characters, the manifestations of religious practice in epic traditions, and the transmission of various kinds of cultural knowledge and practice through storytelling.

Factors to be considered include the interplay between public values and expectations and public policy; the implications of cultural diversity and demographic change, and understandings of ethical principles of conduct in public organizations. A related goal is to help students learn how to use empirical research to answer highly contested issues in policy circles and in public life. These objectives are pursued by introducing students to major trends in inequality in Canada, assessing these trends within a comparative context, reflecting on their normative implications, and examining alternative policy responses to these developments.

VThis module explores debates in geography about social issues. It emphasizes the relationship between social identity and social space, and how different places reflect and shape diverse ways of life. The module examines the role of space in the interplay of different social groups (e.g. ethnic groups, men/women), and in relation to different aspects of daily life (e.g. housing, leisure). Its emphasis, however, is on how to think about these issues in different scales/contexts (streets, public spaces, global cities). The course is intended for geography majors, and students throughout NUS with an interest in the relationship between society and space. (Co-listed as SE2224 National University of Singapore)

VTopic for Spring 2011: Technology and American LifeThis course examines the place of technology in American culture from the 18th century to the present, with a particular focus on the entanglement of commerce (money; markets; manufacturing; industry) with life itself (humans; animals; plants and microbes). What counts as an American life? How have different kinds of life been granted different kinds of value, both historically but also by scholars in the interdisciplinary field of American Studies? How has technology figured in the production, management, taking and (more recently) banking of American life? And how has American life (in all its varied forms and scales) shaped the history of technology? Readings pair recent scholarship with literary and theoretical texts. Key sites of study range from slave pens, iron mills, farms, factories, hospitals and prisons to nuclear test sites, dead malls, toxic ghost towns and organ banks.

VThe course aims to explore the requirements of justice and fairness in international affairs. It is common to theorize international relations in terms of interests and power. But even the most cursory look at what important actors actually do in their international interactions reveals that they use normative language all the time. This has not gone unnoticed, with investigations of ethics in the international arena multiplying in recent years. Drawing on readings from political philosophy, legal theory, and normative international relations theory, the course will take up practical ethical dilemmas encountered in world affairs. The main focus of the course will be on institutions. Examples will be drawn from the issue areas of trade, health, and the environment, among others.

VTopic for fall 2010: Taking Shots at the Man: Assassination and the American PresidencyThis interdisciplinary seminar focuses on political violence directed at the U.S. President from the Civil War to the War on Terror. At key historical moments of national crisis, the office of the Presidency has repeatedly become a target of assassination. While much can be learned by investigating the grievances articulated by assassins, interpretations of their explanations shifted considerably as their acts reverberated through American culture. Public debates surrounding these acts of violence have been framed by historically-specific notions of race, class, gender, and mental fitness. In this class we will cover several assassination attempts from 1865-2001 through interwoven themes of power and memory. As a capstone course, students will be required to pursue original research on a topic of their choice, and write a 25 page research paper.

VFocuses on the interaction between political economy and religion, with a particular focus on how this plays out in cities. In the theoretical realm, most political economists have written extensively on religion at one point or another. It is important to consider what they have said about religion and how it might have affected their ostensibly secular ideas about politics and economy. In the practical realm, religion, as belief system invented by humans, structures a great deal of political and economic activity at a variety of spatial scales. Religion, for example, influences relationships between countries, urban politics, city form, and social class among many other spheres. This course is an introduction to both the theoretical and practical applications of the intersection of political economy and religion.

VThe last phase of the Ottoman empire has long been viewed by Orientalists and Middle East nationalists as a period of inevitable decline. More recently, cultural historians of the Middle East have framed the long 19th. century as a period of grand reforms - or Tanzimat. This course seeks to critically examine the notions of reform of the state and reform of the individual between Sultan Mahmud IIs accession and the defeat of the Ottoman empire in World War I. Focusing largely on Istanbul and the Ottoman capitals political relations with the Arab provinces, we will relate economic, social and intellectual transformations to state laws and policies, Mediterranean capitalism and the rise of sectarianism and nationalism in the Middle East.

Postmodern critical thinking and postcolonial scholarship have in particular made significant impact on ways of rethinking modernism across national histories. This course takes various forms of modernism(s) across China, Taiwan and Hong Kong as the object of study, and the postcolonial and postmodernist approaches to modernism as will include refashioned methodological possibilities. Readings of major modernistic writings, cinema and arts from the above localities. The goal of this course is not to find a better definition for modernism but to release modernisms to fresh ways of thinking and imagination.

VThe universe is not a rigid clockwork, but neither is it formless and random. Instead, it is filled with highly organized, evolved structures that have somehow emerged from simple rules of physics. Examples range from the structure of galaxies to the pattern of ripples on windblown sand, to biological and even social processes. These phenomena exist in spite of the universal tendency towards disorder. How is this possible? Self-organization challenges the usual reductionistic scientific method, and begs the question of whether we can ever really understand or predict truly complex systems.PHY101H1 is primarily intended as a Breadth Requirement course for students in the Humanities and Social Sciences

VEurope is a, landmass and a (transnational) collection of people in both cases rather vaguely defined. Europe is also an idea, one often closely associated with western civilization. So if anthropology is a combination of the ethnographic study of a place and its people, and also the critical study of a culture, then certainly both of these perspectives could usefully be applied to a course on Europe. Both of these dimensions are also of pressing concern to within Europe today.

VThe distinction between nature and culture is often described as a central feature of "modernity" and it certainly remains relevant to many current debates about ecology and environment. This course explores various approaches to "nature" through a variety of written and visual texts, and focuses on representations of the nature/culture dualism. The course's main objectives are 1) to engender discussion and debate about "nature" and how it is represented in a variety of contemporary texts; 2) introduce students to some of the key positions on "nature" among classical and contemporary social theorists; and 3) expose students to pressing ecological issues in a way that fosters their critical engagement with "nature frameworks."

VThis seminar course will foster close interactions between students and Faculty and encourage in depth discussion not only of results but the ways the results were presented and the rationales for experimental design. Critical thinking skills will be developed, as will presentation skills, as students become presenters of results and take on the role of scientist presenting and analyzing new findings. Writing skills will be developed through an essay assignment. Students within the audience will also have access to the experimental papers and be encouraged to pose thoughtful questions about research and the ways that research can be communicated within the scientific community. Thus the new seminar course will foster an appreciation of scientific writing and give students a venue to develop their communication skills. The goal of the seminar course is to improve both the written and oral scientific communication skills of our Specialist students, as well as to increase their knowledge of key papers in Biochemistry.

Emphasis is also given to recent discussions about how diversity and difference in the perception and use of space pose a challenge to the utilitarian and functional definition adopted by the state.

In examining these individuals and acts, attention is also directed to why they are defined as deviant and sanctioned, and why some types of deviance are less likely to be detected and sanctioned than others. Finally, consideration is also given to a range of sanctions that have been used to control deviance and the empirical evidence on their effectiveness.

VThe distinguishing feature of our species is the reflexivity of our consciousness - the ability to conceive of and interpret ourselves and our experiences. For us, consciousness involves self-consciousness. All our higher symbolic capabilities rest upon this foundation. The aim of this course is to trace out a variety of frames through which we may look at and understand the shared aspects of our subjectivity as self-conscious agents. The approach will be multidisciplinary, drawing together ideas and insights from psychology, sociology, philosophy, anthropology, and biology. The broader purpose of the course is to promote articulacy and critical acumen in how we think about reflexive experience. This is not a seminar course.

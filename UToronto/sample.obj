VAs they travel through space and time, material objects play an important role in the production of diasporic identity. This course focuses on the culturally defined and socially regulated processes of circulation, transaction, and use to examine the ways in which diasporic communities identify value and meaning in objects and how those objects give value to the social relations that define communities. Through readings, guest lectures and discussions, we will address questions such as: What roles do objects play in the constitution and reproduction of diasporic communities? What qualities are read into objects, through what mechanisms, and how does their meaning vary across space? What is the relationship between object, narrative, affect and identity? What conditions affect the durability of the relation between object and diasporic identity?

VThis course will examine the phenomenon of individuals and communities who rebel against the general social norms upheld by the majority in societies throughout history. These societal conventions can include generally-accepted moral and religious tenets, as well as the formal legal or political powers employed by those with the levers of social control. The rebels motives can range from the purely criminal, as with many notorious outlaws, to struggles for social justice, in the case of rebellious slaves or proponents of civil disobedience. Students will develop a theoretical framework which they can apply to the lives and motivations of a diverse representation of social rebels and outsiders, among them: pirates and mutineers, bandits and members of street/biker gangs, anarchists, disaffected intellectuals and religious leaders, punks and goths. Besides examining the sociological and philosophical aspects of rebellion, the course will consider the rebel as a prominent element in popular culture.

It will centre around the relatively recent use of K-theory to study Bratteli's approximately finite-dimensional C*-algebras---both to classify them (a result that can be formulated and proved purely algebraically), and to prove that the class of these C*-algebras---what Bratteli called AF algebras---is closed under passing to extensions (a result that uses the Bott periodicity feature of K-theory). Students will be encouraged to prepare oral or written reports on various subjects related to the course, including basic theory and applications

VThe unique combinations of physical, electrical, magnetic, and thermomechanical properties exhibited by advanced technical ceramics has led to a wide range of applications including automobile exhaust sensors and fuel cells, high speed cutting tool inserts and ball bearings, thermal barrier coatings for turbine engines, and surgical implants. This course examines the crystal and defect structures which determine the electrical and mass transport behaviours and the effects of microstructure on optical, magnetic, dielectric, and thermomechanical properties. The influence of these structure-property relations on the performance of ceramic materials in specific applications such as sensors, solid oxide fuel cells, magnets, and structural components is explored.

VWhat is the relationship between place and belonging, between territory and memory? How have the experiences of migration and dislocation challenged the modern assumption that the nation-state should be the limit of identification? What effect has the emergence of new media of communication had upon the coherence of cultural and political boundaries? All of these questions and many more form part of the subject matter of Diaspora and Transnational Studies. This introductory course ex-amines the historical and contemporary movements of peoples and the complex issues of identity and experience to which these processes give rise as well as the creative possibilities that flow from movement and being moved. The area of study is comparative and interdisciplinary, drawing from the social sciences, history, the arts and humanities. Accordingly, this course provides the background to the subject area from diverse perspectives and introduces students to a range of key debates in the field, with particular attention to questions of history, globalization, cultural production and the creative imagination.

VReligion and aesthetics are sometimes constructed as separate categories, but in South Asia religion is not often conceptually distinct from an autonomous sphere of aesthetic reflection. In conversation with recent sociological, anthropological, and philosophical writings, we will explore this issue through careful study of a variety of Sanskrit sources: the epics, Abhinavaguptas commentary on the Natya Sastra, Vaisnava, Saiva, and Jaina appropriations of Sanskrit aesthetics and courtly poetry, and the works of Rabindranath Tagore. Students are encouraged to work with sources in the primary languages, although materials will also be provided in translation

Starting with Harold Innis's theory of staple growth and the debate about the role of foreign investment in its economic (mis)development, we examine how Canada, having long resisted continental economic integration, turned to free trade as a panacea in the 1980s. The course ends with a detailed investigation of NAFTA's significance for Canadian public policy options in the light of the US war on terrorism. It is strongly recommended that students do not take both POL318H1 and POL341H1 at the same time because of the heavy work load.

Advanced genetic principles and approaches used in the study of these animals are introduced, and applied to highly conserved genetic and molecular processes that give rise to common structures such as the limbs, nervous system and eyes. Students completing this course should be able to understand and evaluate any study that makes use of these three major model systems.

This course seeks to consider this tumultuous episode as a field of historical research and conceptual inquiry: What was the meaning of culture in the Cultural Revolution? To what extent was it revolutionary? What did really it mean to talk about class and class struggle during the movement? How is the Cultural Revolution remembered and represented? And, how do we understand Chinas globalizing present in the historical context of the Cultural Revolution? This course invites you to explore such questions by critically examining a wide variety of sources, including scholarly accounts, official documents, personal memoirs, oral histories, and literary works.

VMost urban courses taught in the English-speaking world implicitly or explicitly focus on large North American, European, or Australian cities. While these places are interesting in their own right, studying them as the sole model of urbanization is misleading. To a great extent, the societies of the westernized, developed world are already highly-urbanized and have been so for decades. Cities outside of this sphere, by contrast, are generally growing much faster, and experiencing greater social and economic upheaval as a result. Understanding non-North American urbanization is a vital part of understanding cities in general. This course is an attempt to introduce students to processes of urbanization that are occurring in places other than North America. There will be a particular focus on comparing the urban form, economies, and social life in cities around the world.

VAround 2000 BC, the island of Crete sees the emergence of what are arguably the earliest towns and states in European prehistory. At the heart of this new social order are the so-called \u2018palaces\u2019, massive architectural complexes usually interpreted as seats of administrative and political authority. However, fresh discoveries over the past two decades, coupled recently with radical new interpretations, require a fundamental rethinking of the nature of the palaces and their role in Minoan society. This course will provide students with an active opportunity to learn about the latest developments in Minoan art, architecture, and archaeology.

VThis course, required for majors and minors but open to all who have met the pre-req, explores a range of approaches to the field of American Studies. The course is organized around the decade of the 1920s, a period of tremendous social, political, and economic change as the U.S. emerged from WWI as a global industrial power and Americans debated competing ideas about the meanings of modernity. The course looks at the 1920s through a series of thematic weeks, drawing from interdisciplinary primary and secondary sources, such as black migration and urban modernities; gender, sexuality, and global beauty culture; immigration policy and racial formation; modernism in the visual arts; Prohibition and gangsters; market empires and global commodity chains. Students will be introduced to some of the many theories and methods that have animated the field of American Studies, including historical methods; formal analysis of visual and literary texts; commodity chain analysis; race, commodity, gender, diaspora and affect.

VThis course will examine the religious beliefs and practices of Muslims. The period of time covered by the course is from shortly before the birth of Islam in the 7th century to the present. Attention will focus on the central concerns of the religion: God, Prophethood, Holy Book, Community, the Individual. The sources and development of the Shar\u2018a, the teachings of the mystical tradition, the contributions to art and science, social institutions such as marriage and divorce, family life, the position of women in Islam, modern social changes and the more recent impact of the West on Muslim lands (and vice versa) will also be discussed. Lectures, assignments and workshops will be framed by the close identification between \u201creligion\u201d and \u201ccivilization\u201d found in the Islamic sources, beginning with the Qur \u2019an. Doubtless in part a reflection of the 7th century \u201cview from the Hijaz,\u201d of the contemporary and competing civilizations of the Christian Eastern Roman Empire in the west and the Zoroastrian Iranian Sasanid Empire in the east, this identification may be seen as a presupposition of Islamic religious discourse, beginning with the two foundational opposites, the defining and characteristic Islamic religio-cultural categories: jahiliyya, \u201cignorance, barbarism\u201d and islamiyya, \u201cIsl\u0101m\u201d.

VBasic and advanced principles of genetic analysis applied to the study of two of the best-understood eukaryotic model organisms: the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. We emphasize the use of genetic approaches to address problems in cell biology and development, such as the regulation of cell fate. Much of the knowledge gained from these simple organisms has proven broadly applicable, and the same principles of developmental genetic analysis underlie efforts to understand the development of more complex organisms.

VThis course considers the problem of colonial modernism through a close reading of literary and other cultural tests from early 20th century Korea. It asks what it means to enter modernity under colonial rule, and questions the relationship between imperialism, writing and subjectivity in particular. Topics covered include the role of literature in elaborating new concepts of subjectivity, literature and the fine arts as assimilatory practices, the emergence of urban space and consequent reconfiguration of notions of the rural, and changing notions of time and space in the cultural products of nativism. Readings of literary works will be accompanied by showings of paintings and photographs from the period, as well as discussion of theoretical essays on modernism.

This course introduces students to different approaches to dreams, visions and apparitions, drawing from the fields of psychology, anthropology, history, and religious studies. Topics will include the social life of dreams and visions, the politics of discernment, faith and skepticism, and narrative and visual representations of dreams.

We will focus upon the important developments of literary writing over time, from the inception of New Literature in the 1910s, the development of realism and modernism of the 1930s, to the emergency of post-revolution and postmodernist writings of the 1990s. Great emphasis is also placed on generating a dialogue on interpretations of key works. In doing so, we will be exercising the skills of reading literary works in terms of aesthetic choices and strategies of cultural politics.

VSoutheast Asia has been, and still is comprised of predominantly rural and agrarian societies. This module seeks to develop an understanding of peasant life in the region. Topics to be studied include the village as a construct, the \u201cmoral economy\u201d of the peasantry, land and man relations, economic output, and peasant beliefs, consciousness, and cultural expressions. With the peasants\u2019 increasing involvement in the world market and the nation-state, it is also important to consider the penetration of capitalism into the rural economy, as well as the demand for supra-village identification and loyalties. Notions of \u201cdevelopment\u201d as they pertain to the peasants, and as postulated by the state, non-governmental organizations and the peasants themselves are also discussed.

VExplores the history of Aboriginal peoples (Indigenous and Mtis) living in the Great Lakes Region after the Great Lakes were effectively split between British North America (later Canada) to the north and the united States to the south, when a rapidly increasing newcomer population on both sides of the border marginalized Indigenous peoples and settled on their land. Topics include a comparative examination of Indigenous experiences of colonialism, including treaties and land surrenders as well as the development of government policies aimed at removing and/or assimilating Great Lakes peoples. This course will also study resistance by First National and Tribal Councils to those programs over nearly two centuries and assess local strategies used for economic and cultural survival.

After a series of lectures/seminars on fieldwork methods, fieldwork ethics, and health and safety issues in the field (which may include some basic introductory language classes), students then undertake a 2 \u2013 5 week period of field study overseas, depending on logistical and other constraints. Previous field studies have been for periods of 4-5 weeks overseas in Thailand and Malaysia. While overseas, students undergo orientation workshops, meet peers in host universities, and visit potential field sites before conducting an intensive period of fieldwork in small groups of 3-5 students.

Some commentators assert that a more tightly interconnected world can exacerbate financial disruptions, worsen the gap between rich and poor nations, undermine democracy, imperil national cultures, harm the environment, and give unconstrained freedom to predatory corporations. Others proclaim that globalization - understood as capitalism and free markets - fosters economic growth, Victoria College encourages creative collaboration, inspires technological breakthroughs, and enhances human prospects for a better life, in rich and poor countries alike, in unprecedented ways. Our task is to evaluate the evidence and draw our own conclusions.

The course will begin with theoretical studies on the heroic epic as a literary genre and on oral storytelling traditions cross-culturally. We will then engage in a comparative study and close reading of several Asian epics together with a study of related epic performance practices. Topics to be considered include the social functions and historicity of epic, the nature of heroism and the epic journey, encounters with and characterizations of dangerous and non-human characters, the manifestations of religious practice in epic traditions, and the transmission of various kinds of cultural knowledge and practice through storytelling.

VThis module explores debates in geography about social issues. It emphasizes the relationship between social identity and social space, and how different places reflect and shape diverse ways of life. The module examines the role of space in the interplay of different social groups (e.g. ethnic groups, men/women), and in relation to different aspects of daily life (e.g. housing, leisure). Its emphasis, however, is on how to think about these issues in different scales/contexts (streets, public spaces, global cities). The course is intended for geography majors, and students throughout NUS with an interest in the relationship between society and space. (Co-listed as SE2224 National University of Singapore)

VThe course aims to explore the requirements of justice and fairness in international affairs. It is common to theorize international relations in terms of interests and power. But even the most cursory look at what important actors actually do in their international interactions reveals that they use normative language all the time. This has not gone unnoticed, with investigations of ethics in the international arena multiplying in recent years. Drawing on readings from political philosophy, legal theory, and normative international relations theory, the course will take up practical ethical dilemmas encountered in world affairs. The main focus of the course will be on institutions. Examples will be drawn from the issue areas of trade, health, and the environment, among others.

Begins with a primer on solid-state materials and electronic band description of solids followed by a survey of archetypical solids that have had a dramatic influence on the materials world, some new developments in materials chemistry and a look at perceived future developments in materials research and technology. Strategies for synthesizing many different classes of materials with intentionally designed structures and compositions, textures and morphologies are then explored in detail emphasizing how to control the relations between structure and property of materials and ultimately function and utility. A number of contemporary issues in materials research are critically evaluated to appreciate recent highlights in the field of materials chemistry - an emerging sub-discipline of chemistry.

VThe universe is not a rigid clockwork, but neither is it formless and random. Instead, it is filled with highly organized, evolved structures that have somehow emerged from simple rules of physics. Examples range from the structure of galaxies to the pattern of ripples on windblown sand, to biological and even social processes. These phenomena exist in spite of the universal tendency towards disorder. How is this possible? Self-organization challenges the usual reductionistic scientific method, and begs the question of whether we can ever really understand or predict truly complex systems.PHY101H1 is primarily intended as a Breadth Requirement course for students in the Humanities and Social Sciences

VEurope is a, landmass and a (transnational) collection of people in both cases rather vaguely defined. Europe is also an idea, one often closely associated with western civilization. So if anthropology is a combination of the ethnographic study of a place and its people, and also the critical study of a culture, then certainly both of these perspectives could usefully be applied to a course on Europe. Both of these dimensions are also of pressing concern to within Europe today.

This course explores various approaches to "nature" through a variety of written and visual texts, and focuses on representations of the nature/culture dualism. The course's main objectives are 1) to engender discussion and debate about "nature" and how it is represented in a variety of contemporary texts; 2) introduce students to some of the key positions on "nature" among classical and contemporary social theorists; and 3) expose students to pressing ecological issues in a way that fosters their critical engagement with "nature frameworks."

Emphasis is also given to recent discussions about how diversity and difference in the perception and use of space pose a challenge to the utilitarian and functional definition adopted by the state.
